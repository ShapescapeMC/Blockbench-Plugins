# Blockbench Plugins
This repository hosts a set of custom plugins for the open-source 3D modelling software Blockbench.

## üßë‚Äçüè´ About
### Batch Screenshot
This plugin automates the screenshot process of models programmatically with configurable settings. 

[Learn More](./batch_screenshot/about.md)

### System Template File Loader
This plugin allows for easy importing of PNG and animation files into a project when the geometry file is located in the same directory as the other files. For example, when using a custom folder structure in the Regolith filter system template. It can currently read files from the same directory or from subdirectories.
