# Installation

## Steps

### 1. Install the plugin 
There are two methods that can be used to install the file. We recommend installing via the URL as this is more convenient. 

#### Via URL
TODO

#### From a file


1. Clone this repository.
2. Open Blockbench.
3. Import the plugin file by going to `File -> Plugins... -> Load Plugins from File`. Navigate to `plugins/system_template_file_loader` on the cloned repository and select the `system_template_file_loader.json` file.
4. To confirm that the plugin has been installed correctly, go to `File -> Plugins...`. Under the "Installed" section, you should see `System Template File Loader`.
